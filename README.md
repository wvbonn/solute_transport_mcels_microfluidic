### Description
Simulations of solute transport in a cylindrical tissue construct culture in a microfluidic chamber. The repository contains simulation output files as well as data-processing and -plotting codes.

### Requirements
COMSOL v.6.1 or higher to run the simulation code. COMSOL v.6.1 or higher with LiveLink for MATLAB to run the simulation code from MATLAB or import it into the COMSOL GUI. Without LiveLink for MATLAB, follow the repository simulatin code to create a COMSOL project in the GUI. MATLAB R2021b or higher to run the processing and plotting codes.
